# Day 2: First Virtual Machine

## Date: [Today's Date]

## Objective
Created my first virtual machine for security testing.

## Environment
- Host: Windows 11 Desktop, 32GB RAM
- Hypervisor: [VMware Workstation Player / VirtualBox]
- VM: Windows 11 Enterprise (8GB RAM, 2 CPU cores)

## What I Did
1. Downloaded Windows 11 Enterprise evaluation ISO (5GB)
2. Created VM with 8GB RAM and 60GB disk
3. Installed Windows 11 from ISO
4. Configured local user account (LabUser)
5. Took snapshot: "Fresh Install"
6. Tested network connectivity

## Network Configuration
- IP Address: [Your VM IP]
- Network Mode: NAT
- Can ping: Internet ✓ Host machine [✓ or ✗]

## Snapshots Created
- "Fresh Install - Clean Windows 11" 
- Purpose: Rollback point before making any changes

## Screenshots
[Upload your 3 screenshots]

## Key Learning
- VMs allow safe experimentation
- Snapshots are critical for security labs
- NAT networking provides internet access while isolating VM
- This is the foundation for all future labs

## Next Steps
- Install Sysmon for advanced logging
- Configure Windows security monitoring
- Learn Event Viewer

## Challenges Faced
[Write what was difficult - be honest]

## Time Spent
[Approximate hours]
```

4. Upload your screenshots to the repo
5. Commit changes

Day 2: Built my first virtual machine for security testing! 💻

Installed Windows 11 Enterprise in a VM with 8GB RAM. Learned about:
- VM snapshots (like save points for your lab)
- Network isolation using NAT mode
- Safe experimentation environment

This VM will be my "target" for all security monitoring and testing.

Next: Installing advanced logging tools (Sysmon) to start detecting security events.

Progress: Day 2 of 90
